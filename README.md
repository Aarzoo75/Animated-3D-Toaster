# Animated 3D Toaster using HTML and CSS
This is an animated 3D toaster built using HTML and CSS, which includes several interactive features. When you click on the toaster, the bread will pop up and fly out, and the cute toaster's eye will blink. Additionally, when you move your mouse to the right side of the toaster, it will rotate 3D in that direction. Similarly, when you move your mouse to the left side of the toaster, it will rotate 3D in that direction. Finally, when you move your mouse up or down, the toaster will rotate in that direction.

## How to Use
To use this animated 3D toaster, you can simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. Once you have the page loaded, you can click on the toaster to see the bread pop out and fly away, and the toaster's eye will blink. Then, you can move your mouse to the right or left side of the toaster to see it rotate 3D in that direction. Finally, you can move your mouse up or down to see the toaster rotate in that direction as well.

## How it Works
This animated 3D toaster was built using HTML and CSS. The toaster itself is a div element styled with CSS to look like a toaster. When you click on the toaster, a CSS animation is triggered that causes the bread to pop up and fly away. Additionally, the toaster's eye is a separate div element styled with CSS, and a CSS animation is used to make it blink.

To achieve the 3D rotation effect, CSS transforms are used. When the user moves their mouse to the right or left side of the toaster, a CSS transform is applied to rotate the toaster in the appropriate direction. Similarly, when the user moves their mouse up or down, a CSS transform is used to rotate the toaster in that direction.

## Conclusion
This animated 3D toaster is a fun and interactive example of what can be achieved with HTML and CSS. By using CSS animations and transforms, we were able to create an engaging user experience that includes several interactive features. If you're interested in learning more about how this toaster was built, feel free to dive into the code and experiment with it yourself!
